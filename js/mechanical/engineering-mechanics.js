    "question": "Analysis of deformable bodies in mechanics involves studying:",
    "options": [
      "Rigid body motion",
      "Fluid dynamics",
      "How materials deform under applied loads",
      "Electromagnetic fields"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "How materials deform under applied loads",
    "explanation": "Analysis of deformable bodies in mechanics involves studying how materials deform under applied loads. It includes topics such as stress, strain, and deformation of solid materials under different loading conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Stress on a deformable body refers to:",
    "options": [
      "The internal resistance of the body to deformation",
      "The external force applied to the body",
      "The weight of the body",
      "The temperature of the body"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "The internal resistance of the body to deformation",
    "explanation": "Stress on a deformable body refers to the internal resistance of the body to deformation. It is a measure of the force per unit area acting within the material due to external loads or forces applied to the body."

      "Electromagnetism",
      "Fluid dynamics",
      "Thermodynamics",
      "Statics"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Statics",
    "explanation": "Determinate structures in mechanics are those that can be fully analyzed using the principles of statics. The forces and reactions in such structures can be determined solely from equilibrium equations, without the need for compatibility equations or additional information."

    "question": "A thick-wall cylinder refers to a cylindrical structure with a wall thickness that is:",
    "options": [
      "Negligible compared to the diameter",
      "Significantly larger than the diameter",
      "Uniform along the length",
      "Varying along the length"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Significantly larger than the diameter",
    "explanation": "A thick-wall cylinder refers to a cylindrical structure with a wall thickness that is significantly larger than the diameter. This type of cylinder is commonly used in engineering applications, and the analysis of stress and deformation becomes more complex due to the non-negligible wall thickness."

    "options": [
      "Circular",
      "Rectangular",
      "Triangular",
      "Non-circular"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Non-circular",
    "explanation": "Torsion of non-circular sections involves analyzing the torsional behavior of structural members with cross-sectional shapes that are non-circular. Examples of non-circular sections include I-beams, T-sections, and irregular shapes, which require specialized analysis techniques compared to circular sections."
